    When you install or use the APP, we collect information regarding the type of mobile device on which
    the APP is installed and the operating system being used by the mobile device. We also collect
    information regarding the specific functions of the APP you utilize. This information is collected
    anonymously and not specifically tied to you or your PHYSICIAN. We use this information to better
    understand how users actually use the APP to continually improve it. After you scan the QR Code
    on your printed prescription, the APP will receive detailed information about your prescription for the
    use of the limb restoration device(s)your PHYSICIAN has selected for you. This information is
    transmitted from your PHYSICIAN's password-protected account on Orthofix’s website (the "Website
    Portal") that your PHYSICIAN used to generate your prescription. The APP will transmit your inputs
    detailing your compliance or non-compliance (including the failure to make any inputs) with your
    prescription back to your PHYSICIAN's account on the Website Portal. Your PHYSICIAN will have
    access to all of this information, which directly relates to your treatment. We will access this
    information only at the request of your PHYSICIAN to advise on the proper use of the limb restoration
    device(s) being utilized in your treatment. All information that is transmitted between the APP and
    your PHYSICIAN's account on the Website Portal is encrypted and the data stored by the APP on
    your mobile device cannot be accessed by other applications installed on your mobile device.
